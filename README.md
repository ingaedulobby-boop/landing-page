# AltruisticX AI — Prototype: Hero + Live Experiment Board

What I built
- A self-contained HTML prototype demonstrating:
  - Hero section with headline, subhead, primary and secondary CTAs
  - Live Experiment Board preview: horizontally scrollable cards grouped by status
  - Card hover interaction that flips to show a one-line hypothesis and key metrics
  - Lightweight accessibility considerations (aria labels, keyboard-focusable cards)
  - Uses Tailwind Play CDN for quick viewing and iteration

Why this file
- Fast way to validate layout, copy, and interaction rhythm before investing in a full Figma design or a larger frontend build.

Files included
- index.html — interactive prototype (Tailwind CDN + tiny JS)

How to view
1. Save `index.html` to your computer.
2. Open in a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
3. No build step required — Tailwind CDN is used so it works instantly.

What I need from you to proceed
- Choose deliverable:
  - Option A: Full-page Figma-style mock (visual design + components)
  - Option B: UI kit (Figma components, tokens, copy sheet)
  - Option C: Full coded prototype (React + Tailwind, multi-section, accessible)
- If Option A/B/C, provide (if available):
  - Logo SVG
  - Brand hex colors and preferred fonts (or I’ll use the suggested palette)
  - 2–4 experiments you want surfaced in the Live Board preview (title, one-sentence hypothesis, status, a metric or two)
  - Any preferred analytics, form, or calendar provider (e.g., Calendly, SavvyCal)

Next I will
- If you pick Figma: produce a Figma-ready wireframe export (SVGs + PNGs + component spec) or a Figma file (I’ll prepare downloadable assets that are Figma-ready).
- If you pick Coded prototype: scaffold a React + Tailwind project with the rest of the landing sections (timeline, case-study cards, pricing).
- If you pick UI kit: generate tokens, components, and a copy CSV for handoff.

I’m ready to continue — tell me which option you want and share any brand assets or 3 eksperiments to show in the board.
