# AltruisticX AI — Landing Page UI Design Spec

Goal
- Convert impact-driven orgs (nonprofits, campus teams, civic orgs, edtech) into 4-week pilot inquiries.
- Communicate trust: ethical stance, ownership of code, transparency via Live Experiment Board.
- Lower friction: async-first model, simple booking and low-commitment flows.

Tone
- Clear, earnest, confident, human-first.
- Avoid hype; emphasize craft, evidence, and ethics.

Key UX principles
- Lead with mission and outcome (what they get in 4 weeks).
- Show credible social proof and shipped metrics.
- Make the Experiment Board tangible and explorable.
- Minimize cognitive load for booking a pilot or requesting a scoping call.
- Mobile-first, accessible, and fast.

Primary target audiences
- Campus sustainability/facilities managers
- EdTech program leads & teachers
- Civic coalition program directors
- Founders / small impact startups (1–50 ppl)

Core CTAs
- Primary: “Start a 4‑Week Pilot” (leads to short intake form + calendar)
- Secondary: “Explore Live Experiments” (opens experiment board)
- Tertiary: “See Shipped Work” / “Read Case Studies”

Header & Nav
- Left: AltruisticX logo (wordmark + icon).
- Nav items: Work / Experiments / How it works / Pricing / Blog
- Right: Primary CTA “Start a 4‑Week Pilot” (prominent), Secondary: “Explore Experiments”
- Sticky header with subtle blur; shrink on scroll.

Hero (desktop split layout)
- Left: succinct headline (see copy options), subhead (1–2 lines), 2 CTAs horizontally (Primary and Secondary), trust badges under CTAs.
- Right: dynamic visual:
  - Option A: animated “experiment board” mockup showing cards changing status.
  - Option B: stylized flow diagram: Idea → Week 1 foundations → Week 4 deliverable (repo + docs).
  - Option C: composite screenshot carousel (energy dashboard, edtech portal, founder OS).
- Use concise value bullets below: “4 weeks · You own the code · Ethical, explainable AI”.

Hero copy variants (pick one)
- Variant 1 — Outcome-first:
  - Headline: “Working AI prototypes in 4 weeks — for education, energy, and civic impact.”
  - Subhead: “Fast pilots you can own: repo, docs, and deployable demos built with transparency and ethics.”
  - CTA primary: “Start a 4‑Week Pilot”
  - CTA secondary: “Explore Live Experiments”

- Variant 2 — Risk-minimizing:
  - Headline: “Low‑risk AI pilots that deliver value — pause anytime, own everything.”
  - Subhead: “Async-first sprints for impact organizations. We ship working prototypes, you keep the code.”
  - CTAs as above

- Variant 3 — Narrative & mission:
  - Headline: “Trusted AI for social good — small teams, real results.”
  - Subhead: “We prototype ethical, explainable AI that helps schools, campuses, and civic groups move decisions forward.”
  - CTAs as above

Proof strip
- Horizontal strip under hero with:
  - Logos (campus partners, civic coalitions) — grayscale, clickable to case studies
  - Key metrics: “30 pilots run”, “12 shipped”, “uptime 99.9%”, “Avg time to demo: 4 weeks”
  - Optional small testimonial quote toggle

How it works — 3-step timeline (interactive)
- Visual timeline cards:
  - Week 0–1: Foundation — repo, CI/CD, staging demo
  - Week 2–3: Build & Integrate — frontend, AI features, tests
  - Week 4: Ship & Handoff — docs, ownership, next steps
- Each card expands on hover/tap to show deliverables, acceptance criteria, and example outputs.
- Include “Pause at any time” microcopy and a “what we need from you” callout (decision owner, data access).

Live Experiment Board (hero feature)
- UI concept: mini-app embedded in the landing page (preview) with link to full board.
- Header controls:
  - Filters: Domain (Energy, Education, Civic), Status (Now Shipping, Looking for Partners, Shelved), Tech tags (NLP, Time-series, Computer Vision, Dashboards)
  - Sort: Last updated, Status, Popularity
  - Search box
- Card layout:
  - Card shows: title, one-line hypothesis, status badge (color-coded: green shipping, blue seeking partners, gray shelved), small metrics (e.g., users, sites), CTA: “View details”
  - Expanded detail (modal or side-panel): problem statement, outcome to date, repo link (for shipped), short deploy demo GIF (if shipped), ethics notes (why we paused or accepted).
- Interaction: Live badges update (animate) on load to underscore “live”.

Example pilots / case studies
- Use 3 feature cards (Energy, Education, Founder OS).
- Each card includes:
  - Problem → hypothesis → result bullets (metrics where possible)
  - “What we delivered” (list)
  - “You can have this in 4 weeks” microCTA
- Link to full case study pages.

What we won’t build / Ethical boundary
- Compact two-column block:
  - Left: Principles (Explainability, No black‑box for public-serving systems, No political surveillance)
  - Right: “Not a fit” quick list (large enterprise procurement cycles, political monitoring products, product wishlists without user problem)
- Design: use neutral backgrounds and icons to show stance without moralizing.

Pricing / Engagement model (transparent & simple)
- Cards for 3 options:
  - 1‑Week Foundation (proof-of-setup, repo + staging) — entry-level
  - 4‑Week Pilot (full prototype, docs, handoff) — recommended
  - Pilot → Scale (estimate & engagement plan after pilot)
- Each card lists deliverables and next steps.
- CTA on each card: “Start this” or “Request pricing”
- If pricing is customized, offer “Book a 15-minute intake” with calendar widget.

Testimonials & partners
- Rotating quotes with headshots, role, org
- Logos carousel (auto-scroll, accessible)

FAQ — 6 top questions
- Short Q/A: ownership, data handling, timelines, ethics, how to partner on a shelved project, cancellation policy.

Accessibility
- Contrast: all text meet AA (prefer AAA for hero)
- Keyboard navigation for experiment board
- ARIA roles for dialog, filters, and cards
- Alt text for images/screenshots
- Focus-visible styles for actionable elements
- Use prefers-reduced-motion for animated mockups

Microinteractions
- Button hover: elevate + subtle amber glow for primary CTA
- Status badge updates: gentle pulse when “Now Shipping”
- Filter chips: toggle animation, count badges
- Card expansion: slide-in panel from right for details

Experiment Board details (data & UX)
- Schema for card data:
  - id, title, hypothesis, status, domain, tags, updated_at, metrics, demo_url, repo_url, ethics_note
- Default view shows newest “Now Shipping” at top
- Ability to “subscribe” to an experiment updates (email) — collect consent
- Provide public repo link for shipped items (or sanitized public snapshot)

Conversion flows
- Primary flow: CTA → 3-field triage form (Org name, Problem in 1 sentence, Contact email) → calendar widget or “Request intake” → confirmation email with next steps and optional pre-intake form.
- Lightweight alternative: CTA opens modal with “Is this a fit?” checklist (domain, decision maker, data access) with inline scheduling.

SEO & content strategy
- Title & H1 alignment: “AltruisticX AI — 4‑week AI pilots for education, energy, and civic impact”
- Use structured data (Organization, Service, CaseStudy)
- Dedicated pages for top experiments (good for long-tail SEO)
- Blog/notes: rapid posts about experiments and learnings (transparency builds trust)

Analytics & experimentation
- Track events: CTA clicks, experiment-card views, filter usage, form starts, form completions.
- Setup A/B tests:
  - Hero copy variant A vs B
  - Experiment Board preview vs static image
  - Primary CTA copy: “Start a 4‑Week Pilot” vs “Book a 15‑min Intake”
- Monitor conversion by domain (education vs energy etc.)

Performance & delivery notes
- Defer heavy experiment board data load; load initial preview as JSON snapshot, fetch details on demand.
- Use optimized screenshots, WebP, and placeholder LQIP.
- Server-side render hero content for SEO.
- Preconnect to calendar and analytics providers.
